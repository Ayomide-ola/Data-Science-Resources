The engenier had told you they want to downplay the importance of reading produced from sensor a_555 and a_34 only because they are not important. how do you implement calculating weighted mean in python for 1,000000 records of sensors with consideration to the engineers request and explain what each element of the code means and does relative to out output overall"
